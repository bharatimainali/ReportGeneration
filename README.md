# ReportGeneration

I solved this task by first understanding the problem. Also took help from ChatGpt to further elaborate the problem to me.
After that I came to know that the problem has following main steps.

1. I need to come up with something so I can monitor a folder and when we paste file in it only then the code should process it
2. read xml files and process xml files into objects
3. perform calculations
4. store the output into an xml file

Furthermore. Below are the reference links I took help from
